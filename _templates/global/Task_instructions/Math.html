       <h3>Basics</h3>
       On your screen you will see 16 gray boxes. Each box hides a simple addition (like '1+1' or '2+3') and a colored heart (red ‚ù§Ô∏è or black üñ§). 
       By clicking on a box you can reveal its content.
       Your task is to click on the boxes to find matching pairs. Two boxes form a matching pair if both of the following are true:
       <ol>
           <li> The sums are the same. </li>
           <li> The hearts are the same color. </li>
       </ol>
       In other words, two boxes are a matching pair if both the sums and the colors are the same.
       
       <br><br>
       Below are two examples: the top image shows a non-matching pair, while the bottom image shows a matching pair.

       <h3>Sets</h3>
       You will start with a set of 16 boxes, which means there are 8 matching pairs in total.
       Each time you find a matching pair, the two boxes will disappear.
       After finding all matching pairs in a set, <strong>a new set</strong> of 16 boxes will appear. 
       There is a maximum of 3 sets.

       <h3>Scoring</h3>
       You earn one point for each matching pair you find.
       There are a maximum of 24 points you can score.
