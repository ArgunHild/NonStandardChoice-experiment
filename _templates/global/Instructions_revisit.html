        In the next set of pages, you'll revisit the <strong>15 choices</strong> you made earlier in the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each of the 15 earlier decisions, you’ll now see two bundles: the one originally assigned and an alternative. 
        You’ll be asked to <strong>choose which bundle you would prefer to receive as your final outcome</strong>.
    </p>



    <p>
        Your final selection for each choice will be recorded and used as your outcome for the study.
